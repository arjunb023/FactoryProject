System Name
	KitPanel
System Description
	The kit panel allows the user to select how many parts of each type they want in a kit, and create any number of that kit. They can then submit the order and the factory will create those kits.
Requirements
	The kit panel should allow the user to enter up to 8 parts in a kit, of any type they choose, and then display how many of each part they have entered. Then they should be allowed to name the kit they have created, enter how many of the kit they want, and submit the order to the factory, which is separate from actually starting the factory animation.
